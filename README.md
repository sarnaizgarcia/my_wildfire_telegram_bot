# my_wildfire_bot

Technical test that consists on creating a bot that determinates origin date of wildfires. This is the frontend.

To run the app, you will need to:

1. Create a venv folder:

```
$ python3 -m venv venv
```

2. Activate venv:

```
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the [backend repository](https://github.com/sarnaizgarcia/my_wildfire_bot/blob/master/README.md)

6. Run the frontend:

```
python bot.py
```

Write "/start" and the bot will answer.
